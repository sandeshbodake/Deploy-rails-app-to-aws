# Build a Rails App

## Overview

In this lesson you're going to build a complete Ruby on Rails application that manages related data through complex forms and RESTful routes. The goal of the application is to build a Content Management System, whether the content being managed is Blog Posts, Recipes, a Library of Resources, or any domain model that lends itself to these requirements (the majority of ideas you could come up with would probably meet the requirements).

## Requirements

1. Your models must include a `has_many`, a `belongs_to`, and a `has_many :through` relationship. You can include more models to fill out your domain, but there must be at least a model acting as a join table for the has_many through.

2. Your models should include reasonable validations for the simple attributes. You don't need to add every possible validation or duplicates, such as presence and a minimum length, but the models should defend against invalid data.

3. You should be able to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete actions on at least two of your resources.

4. Once you've implemented the above, you may add a standard user authentication, including signup, login, logout, and passwords.

5. Your should, within reason, build a a DRY (Do-Not-Repeat-Yourself) rails app. Logic present in your controllers should be encapsulated as methods in your models. Your views should use helper methods and partials to be as logic-less as possible. Follow patterns in the [Rails Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide) and the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).


### Example Domains

- A Recipe Manager - Should provide the ability to browse recipes by different filters such as date created, ingredient count, rating, comments, whatever your domain provides. Additionally ingredients would need to be unique so that the first user that adds Chicken to their recipe would create the canonical (or atomic/unique/individual) instance of Chicken (the only row to ever have the name Chicken in the ingredients table). This will force a join model between ingredients and recipes and provide an easy way to group recipes by ingredients, which would be a great view to implement. Associating some user-centric data regarding recipes such as ratings or comments would further fill out the domain and provide some great learning experiences.

- A Group Task Manager - An application that allowed the creation of task lists with individual tasks that can be assigned to a user would flex the majority of the requirements of this assessment. You would be able to create a list of tasks, add tasks to that list, and assign those task to a user.

### Restricted Domains

- A Blog App - We used a Blog domain design for a lot of the rails lessons and code-alongs.

- An Amusement Park - This is the domain design for one of the final Rails projects. Try to find inspiration from this project and build something unique and different.


## Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your Rails application.
2. Build your application. Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable.
3. Make sure you and your partner are using good pair-programming practices. Switch the driver every 20 minutes or so. This is a learning opportunity - use this time to solidify your understandings and teach each other.
